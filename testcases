***Deleting a playlist*** 
1. Delete one playlist
2. Delete multiple playlists (worked for 10+ in a row) 

***The playlists are meant to be untouched and auto scraped, and not manually edited***

***User manual manipulation on playlist Cases***
1. Changing playlist name manually in Spotify (the playlist name on Spotify will not match the database up until the playlist is filtered again with a new playlist name).
2. Manually adding songs in Spotify (these tracks will be untouched if it's not a part of the filter).
3. Manually removing songs in Spotify (App works fine with this case)
4. If editing or deleting a playlist that was deleted manually on Spotify side, the playlist will be deleted in the database.
